    <h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
    <p>Dear Eileen.</p>
   <p>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science factualy to study as part
    <br>
	of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one.in the following sections.</p>

	<h3>Satring Dates</h3>
	<p>we are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,however it would suit us better if you
	<br>
	could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>First semester.9 September 2016</li>
	<li>Second semester.15 January 2017</li>
	<li>Third semester. 2 May 2017</li>		
	</ul>

	<p>Please let me know if this ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
	<br>
	<br>
	You can find more information about <a href="" >important university dates</a> on our website</p>

	<h3>Subjects of study</h3>

	<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty,we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall
	<br>
	somewhere in the realm of science and technology.You seem like an intelligent.dedicated researcher,and just
	<br>	
	the kind of person we`d like to have on your team . Saying that,of the ideas you submittedw were most intrigued
	<br>
	by are as follows,in order of priority:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into win,and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
	<li>Measuring the effects on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>(86<sup>o</sup>F),when the
	<br>
	audience size exponentially increases(effect of 3 x 10 <sup>3</sup>increasing to 3 x 10 <sup>4</sup>)	
	 </li>
	 <li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>
<p>So please can you provide more information on each og these subjects,including how long you'd expect the
<br>
research to take,required staff and other resources,and anything else you think we'd need to know ?Thanks.</p>

<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
<p>Yes,you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work,I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances.To answer your questions,
<br>
my favourite dances are as follows,withdefinitions:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
	<dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC,a wholevillage would dance around
	<br>
	in a circle like chickens,to encourage their livestock to be "fruitfull".
	</dd>
	<dt>icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
	<dd>Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,they used to practice this dance,which
		<br>
		involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor.and shuffling their bodies arround in imperceptibly
		<br>
		tiny,very rapid movements.one of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dancce inspired
		<br>
		modern styles such as Twerking.
	</dd>
	<dt>Artict robot dance</dt>
	<dd>An interseting example of historic misinformation,English explores in the 1960s belived to have
	<br>
	discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilled movements,being practiced by inhabitants
	<br>
	of Northem Alaska and Canada.Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
	<br>
	because they were really cold.
	</dd>
